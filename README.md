# Supply-chain-Optimization
Supply chain route optimization represents a critical challenge in modern logistics, where
 companies must balance cost efficiency, delivery speed, and service quality while managing
 increasingly complex distribution networks. This comprehensive project demonstrates how
 advanced graph algorithms and machine learning techniques can revolutionize logistics planning
 to achieve significant reductions in transportation costs and delivery times.
 Project Overview and Objectives
 The primary goal of this supply chain route optimization system is to develop an intelligent
 platform that leverages cutting-edge computational techniques to solve the Vehicle Routing
 Problem VRP) and its variants. The system integrates multiple optimization algorithms with
 machine learning capabilities to provide adaptive, real-time route planning that responds to
 changing conditions such as traffic patterns, weather events, and demand fluctuations.

Key Objectives
 Cost Reduction: Minimize total transportation costs through optimal route planning and
 resource allocation
 Delivery Time Optimization: Reduce overall delivery times while maintaining service level
 agreements
 Scalability: Handle large-scale logistics networks with thousands of delivery points
 Adaptability: Incorporate real-time data and dynamic routing adjustments
 Sustainability: Reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions through efficient routing
